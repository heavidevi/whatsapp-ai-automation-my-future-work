              <li>
                <strong>Your phone number</strong> — provided by WhatsApp / Messenger / Instagram
                when you message us.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The content of your messages</strong> — text, images, voice notes

                <strong>Business details you share</strong> with the bot to build a website /

                hours, contact details for your own customers, etc.

              <li>
                <strong>Payment records</strong> if you activate a paid service — Stripe handles
                card data; we receive only the payment status, the email and name on the receipt,
                and the amount.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>To deliver the service you asked for</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR —
                performance of a contract). Generating a website needs your business name;
                sending you a payment link needs your phone number; etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>To improve the service and prevent abuse</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) —
                legitimate interests). We log conversations so a human can step in when the bot
                gets stuck, and we use anonymised feedback signals to improve responses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)) — accounting /
                tax records for paid transactions.

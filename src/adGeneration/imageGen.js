=== YOUR CREATIVE BRIEF ===

INDUSTRY: ${industryLabel}
PRODUCT/SERVICE: ${nicheLabel}
PRODUCT TYPE: ${productType}

PRODUCT (uploaded image):
- This is the HERO product — preserve its exact appearance, colors, packaging, and design perfectly
- Enhance with premium ${is3D ? '3D studio lighting (ray-traced reflections, soft shadows)' : 'studio lighting and realistic shadows'} appropriate to this product category
- Position as the dominant focal point

${colorDirective}

BACKGROUND & SCENE:
- Study the product and create a scene that feels AUTHENTIC to the ${industryLabel} industry
- ${industryMoodGuide}
- The scene should feel like a premium ${industryLabel} brand campaign
- Dramatic lighting, depth, and cinematic quality
- The background MUST fill the entire frame — never plain white unless brief explicitly requests it

BRAND NAME: "${brandName}"
- Include the brand name prominently in the ad
- Choose a placement and style that feels natural for ${industryLabel} advertising

Campaign Theme: ${ideaTitle}
${styleContext ? `\n=== CREATIVE DIRECTION FROM ART DIRECTOR ===\n${styleContext}` : ''}
${threeDOverride}

=== TYPOGRAPHY DIRECTION (Use Your Expert Judgment) ===

You have FULL CREATIVE FREEDOM for typography:

${slogan ? `HEADLINE: "${slogan}"
- Typography that feels NATIVE to ${industryLabel}
- Analyze scene colors → pick PERFECT CONTRAST
- Bold, commanding, readable at any size` : ''}

${pricing ? `PRICE ELEMENT: "${pricing}"
- Design a price presentation NATIVE to this ad's aesthetic and ${industryLabel} norms
- Shape, colors, position — all your creative call
- Must be noticeable but elegant` : ''}

CTA BUTTON: The button text MUST be exactly the words "${smartCTA}" — write these exact words inside the button. Do NOT write "CTA", do NOT write a placeholder, do NOT write any other phrase.
- Design the button with a premium feel that matches the ad aesthetic
- Natural next step for a ${industryLabel} customer
- Prominent placement, sized for impact

=== YOUR EXPERTISE PRINCIPLES ===
- Visual hierarchy: Product → Brand → Headline → Price → CTA
- Color theory for readability, breathing room for text
- Every element readable at thumbnail size
- This should look like an ad FROM a top ${industryLabel} brand

AVOID: Duplicating elements, clutter, text lost in busy areas, plain white backgrounds.

⚠️ TEXT ACCURACY — READ CAREFULLY:
- The brand name is EXACTLY: "${brandName}" — spell each word exactly as shown, do NOT repeat, skip, rearrange, or add any words
- The CTA button text is EXACTLY: "${smartCTA}" — these exact words inside the button, never "CTA"
- Each text string (brand name${slogan ? ', slogan' : ''}${pricing ? ', price' : ''}, CTA) must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the image
- Do NOT add product specifications (weight, volume, dimensions, calories) unless they were in the uploaded product image OR explicitly stated in the brief above

=== VISUAL CREATION ===

You must CREATE a stunning visual that represents this ${industryLabel} brand. Study what the TOP brands in ${industryLabel} do and create something equally compelling.

YOUR CREATIVE APPROACH (choose the best for this ${industryLabel} ${productType}):

OPTION A — PRODUCT/BRAND VISUALIZATION:
- Imagine and CREATE what this ${nicheLabel} product/service looks like
- Place it in a premium, industry-authentic environment
- ${industryMoodGuide}
- Make the viewer DESIRE this product/service

OPTION B — LIFESTYLE & ASPIRATION:
- Show the LIFESTYLE or OUTCOME this ${nicheLabel} enables
- Create a scene showing what life looks like WITH this brand
- Aspirational but believable — the viewer should say "I want that"
- Use environments authentic to ${industryLabel}

OPTION C — ABSTRACT PREMIUM:
- Create a visually stunning abstract/artistic representation
- Rich textures, dramatic lighting, premium materials relevant to ${industryLabel}
- The environment itself should FEEL like the brand's values
- Sophisticated, high-end, scroll-stopping

Choose whichever approach creates the most STUNNING, SCROLL-STOPPING visual for a ${industryLabel} brand.

=== CRITICAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS ===
- This ad must be SCROLL-STOPPING on social media
- Create a scene so visually striking people pause immediately
- The visual should feel AUTHENTIC to the ${industryLabel} industry — NOT generic
- NOT a stock photo look — this must feel CUSTOM and PREMIUM
- The visual should make ${brandName} feel like a billion-dollar ${industryLabel} company
- Background MUST fill the entire frame with the described scene — NEVER plain white unless intentional

=== TYPOGRAPHY (Your Expert Judgment) ===

BRAND NAME: "${brandName}"
- This is the STAR — make it ICONIC and memorable
- Choose typography that would work as a premium ${industryLabel} brand identity
- Position prominently
- Must feel like a brand people would TRUST

${slogan ? `TAGLINE: "${slogan}"
- Supporting text that reinforces the brand promise
- Style that COMPLEMENTS the brand name and feels native to ${industryLabel}
- Perfect contrast with your scene` : ''}

${pricing ? `PRICE/OFFER: "${pricing}"
- Design a price presentation that feels PREMIUM, not cheap
- Badge, ribbon, or elegant callout based on what fits YOUR scene and ${industryLabel} norms
- Noticeable but not overwhelming` : ''}

CTA BUTTON: The button text MUST be exactly the words "${smartCTA}" — write these exact words inside the button. Do NOT write "CTA", do NOT write a placeholder, do NOT write any other phrase.
- Design the button with a premium feel matching the overall ad aesthetic
- Prominent but not garish

=== YOUR CREATIVE PRINCIPLES ===
- Visual hierarchy: Scene → Brand Name → Tagline → Price → CTA
- The SCENE is as important as the text — make it STUNNING
- Color harmony between visual and typography
- Every element readable at thumbnail size
- This should look like a premium ${industryLabel} advertising campaign, not a template

CRITICAL: Each text element appears EXACTLY ONCE. No duplicates.

⚠️ TEXT ACCURACY — READ CAREFULLY:
- The brand name is EXACTLY: "${brandName}" — spell each word exactly as shown, do NOT repeat, skip, rearrange, or add any words
- The CTA button text is EXACTLY: "${smartCTA}" — these exact words inside the button, never "CTA"
- Each text string (brand name${slogan ? ', slogan' : ''}${pricing ? ', price' : ''}, CTA) must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the image
- Do NOT add product specifications (weight, volume, dimensions, calories, ingredients) unless explicitly stated in the brief above

CREATE: An advertisement so visually striking it would trend on social media and make ${brandName} look like the #1 brand in ${industryLabel}.`;

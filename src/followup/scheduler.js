/**
 * Follow-Up Scheduler
 *
 * Website/domain flow uses a single nudge at 22h: apply a 20% discount to
 * the website price (domain cost is fixed by Namecheap and can't be cut),
 * deactivate the old Stripe link, issue a new one, and redeploy the site
 * banner so the strikethrough pricing shows. Preview site self-destructs
 * at 23h via siteCleanup — the 1-hour gap between discount and expiry is
 * the close window.
 *
 * Split payments are NOT offered — kept out intentionally because (a) at
 * $199 the ticket is already low enough that splitting is friction not
 * value, and (b) the discount alone is a cleaner single-decision pitch.

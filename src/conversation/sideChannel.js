// Side-channel intent classifier for collection states.
//
// Problem this solves:
// The bot is mid-flow asking the user for field X (e.g. "which city are
// you based in?") — but the user replies with content that's actually
// about field Y ("we also do AC selling" — a service add, not a city).
// Without this helper, the state-specific extractor returns "unclear"
// and the bot falls back to a re-ask, ignoring the user's real intent.
//
// What this does:
// One LLM call classifies what the user actually meant. The handler can
// then apply the side-channel update (append the service, change the
// business name, etc.) and re-ask the original question naturally.
//
// Result shape (one of):
//   { kind: 'service_add',    services: [string] }
//   { kind: 'name_change',    value: string }
//   { kind: 'industry_change', value: string }
//   { kind: 'contact_update', email: string|null, phone: string|null, address: string|null }
//   { kind: 'question',       question: string }
//   { kind: 'unclear' }
//
// Use it AFTER your state-specific extractor concludes the message isn't
// a clean answer to the current question. Don't run it on every turn —
// it's a fallback classifier, not a primary one.

Their reply did NOT cleanly answer the current question. Classify what they actually meant. Reply in ANY language is OK — read the meaning, not just keywords. Return ONLY valid JSON.

HARD RULE — anti-"unclear" bias for contact info: if the message contains ANY of (a) the literal word "Address" / "Email" / "Phone" / "Mobile" / "Tel" / "Number" followed by a value, OR (b) an at-sign with text on both sides, OR (c) a run of 6+ digits, OR (d) a street/road/avenue/lane/block/sector/colony/nagar/society keyword followed by a place token, OR (e) a short 2-5 word phrase ending with a recognizable city / region / country name (Karachi / Lahore / Islamabad / Mumbai / Delhi / Bangalore / Dubai / London / NYC / Austin / Toronto / etc.) — you MUST return contact_update with the matching field set. Do NOT return unclear for these cases. Examples that are ALL contact_update, never unclear:
   - "Address zamzama road karachi" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"zamzama road karachi","email":null,"phone":null}
   - "Phone 03353279708" → {"kind":"contact_update","phone":"03353279708","email":null,"address":null}
   - "Email is foo@bar.com" → {"kind":"contact_update","email":"foo@bar.com","phone":null,"address":null}
   - "5 jail road, lahore" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"5 jail road, lahore","email":null,"phone":null}
   - "Block 4 gulshan-e-iqbal" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"Block 4 gulshan-e-iqbal","email":null,"phone":null}
   - "Abc karachi" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"Abc karachi","email":null,"phone":null}
   - "F-7 Markaz Islamabad" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"F-7 Markaz Islamabad","email":null,"phone":null}
   - "Andheri east mumbai" → {"kind":"contact_update","address":"Andheri east mumbai","email":null,"phone":null}

CONTEXT (do not re-add fields the user already gave):
- Business name: ${knownName ? `"${knownName}"` : 'unknown'}
- Industry: ${knownIndustry ? `"${knownIndustry}"` : 'unknown'}
- Existing services list: ${knownServices.length ? JSON.stringify(knownServices) : '(empty)'}

Possible classifications:

1. **service_add** — the user is naming ONE OR MORE specific services they ALSO offer (in addition to the existing list). Phrasing varies across languages — focus on intent, not keywords. The user is saying "we also do X" / "we also offer Y" / "X is something we provide too" — where X and Y are CONCRETE service names (Haircut, Pedicure, Beard Trim, Massage, etc.).

   **HARD RULE — do NOT extract generic placeholders.** If the user asks *"can we add one more service?"* / *"there is one more service, can we add that?"* / *"add another one"* / *"add a new service"* — they are ASKING about adding, not naming the service. The phrase "one more service" / "another service" / "new service" is NOT a service name. Classify as **question** instead so we can ask them what the service is called. Same goes for placeholder-y nouns like "service", "another", "item", "thing", "one" — never treat those as service names.

   Return ONLY genuinely new, named services — if they're echoing services already in the existing list, or using a placeholder phrase, do NOT classify as service_add.
   Shape: {"kind":"service_add","services":["<new service 1>","<new service 2>"]}

2. **name_change** — user wants to update the business name. Phrases like "actually it's called X", "name should be X", "change name to X".
   Shape: {"kind":"name_change","value":"<new name>"}

   IMPORTANT — typo / substring corrections preserve the rest of the existing name.
   When the user is fixing a TYPO inside the existing knownName (phrasings like
   "its not X, its Y" / "Sorry, Y" / "I meant Y" / "no, Y" — where Y is similar
   in spelling/phonetics to a word already in knownName), return the COMPLETE
   corrected name preserving every word of knownName that they aren't replacing.
   Do NOT return just the corrected token alone.

   Examples (knownName carries info to preserve):
   - knownName="Ansh Salin", user="its not Salin, its Salon"  → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Ansh Salon"}
   - knownName="Ansh Salin", user="Sorry, Ansh Salon"          → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Ansh Salon"}
   - knownName="Bytes Platfrom", user="Sorry, Bytes Platform"  → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Bytes Platform"}
   - knownName="Lion Cafe", user="its Lion Café not Cafe"      → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Lion Café"}
   - knownName="Ansh Salin", user="actually call it Vibe"      → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Vibe"}   (full replace — explicit rename, NOT a typo correction)
   - knownName="Ansh Salin", user="change name to Vibe Studio" → {"kind":"name_change","value":"Vibe Studio"}  (full replace — explicit rename)

3. **industry_change** — user wants to update the industry / niche.
   Shape: {"kind":"industry_change","value":"<new industry>"}

4. **contact_update** — the user is volunteering an email, phone, or street address (when we weren't asking for it). Be generous here: any message that ALMOST looks like contact info should land as contact_update, not unclear. Specifically:
   - Explicit labels: "Address X" / "address: X" / "phone is X" / "email X" / "the address is X" — extract the value, set the matching field.
   - Bare prose with a street/road/colony/sector hint and a place name ("zamzama road karachi", "5 main street, austin", "block 4 gulshan", "23 jail road") — that's an address, set the address field.
   - Phone-shaped digit runs and email-shaped strings always count.
   Shape: {"kind":"contact_update","email":"<email or null>","phone":"<phone or null>","address":"<address or null>"}

5. **question** — the user is asking us a question (not answering ours).
   Shape: {"kind":"question","question":"<short paraphrase>"}

6. **unclear** — none of the above. The reply is genuinely off-topic, confused, or testing.
   Shape: {"kind":"unclear"}

Rules:
- The HARD RULE for contact info above OVERRIDES every other rule below. If the message has an Address/Email/Phone label, an at-sign, a 6+ digit run, or a street/road/block/sector keyword, it IS contact_update and never unclear — even if you're tempted to call it unclear.
- ONLY classify as service_add when the user is genuinely adding to the services list. "We do plumbing" when industry is already Plumbing → unclear, NOT service_add.
- For service_add, return the NEW services only — strip the ones already in the existing list (case-insensitive).
- For name_change / industry_change: only if the user EXPLICITLY signals a change (not just mentions a different word in passing).
- When in doubt between an actionable category (service_add / name_change / industry_change / contact_update / question) and unclear → pick unclear. But contact info always wins per the HARD RULE.

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.`;

Fields you may extract (only the ones in this list — ignore others):
${missing.map((f) => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}

Field rules:
- businessName: the trade name of the business (NOT the user's personal name unless explicitly stated as the business name).
- industry: 1-3 word niche label, e.g. "HVAC", "Salon", "Restaurant", "Real estate". **Business-name inference is REQUIRED, not optional**: if the already-known businessName or the message contains a clear trade word, extract that as the industry. This is explicit signal from the user — a business literally named "X Plumbing" has industry "Plumbing". Concrete mappings:
    • "Hasnain Plumbing" → "Plumbing"
    • "Bright Dental" → "Dental"
    • "Joe's Auto Repair" → "Auto Repair"
    • "Maria's Thai Kitchen" → "Thai Restaurant"
    • "Acme Bakery" → "Bakery"
    • "Glow Studio Salon" → "Salon"
    • "Smith & Smith Law" → "Legal"
    • "SunCity Roofing" → "Roofing"
    • "Pure Clean Cleaners" → "Cleaning Services"
    • "FastFix Locksmith" → "Locksmith"
  If the businessName is GENERIC ("TechCorp", "Glow Studio", "BlueBird Ventures") with no trade word, leave industry unset.
- primaryCity: the city the business is based in.
- serviceAreas: array of cities/neighborhoods they serve. May overlap with primaryCity.
- services: array of SPECIFIC services or products offered. IMPORTANT: when the user's answer just echoes their industry in generic terms ("we do plumbing", "plumbing services", "all types of plumbing", "every kind of roofing work", "the usual dental stuff", "full-service X", "general X services"), treat it as delegation and OMIT the services field entirely — downstream code will supply trade-specific defaults. Only populate services when the user names DISTINCT, CONCRETE services ("leak repair, drain cleaning, water heater install" or "haircut, beard trim, color"). Single-entry results like ["Plumbing services"] or ["Roofing"] are WRONG — omit the field in those cases.
- contactAddress: physical street address.

Already known (do NOT re-extract these): ${JSON.stringify({
    businessName: known.businessName || undefined,
    industry: known.industry || undefined,
    primaryCity: known.primaryCity || undefined,

Extract the industry as a clean 1-3 word label (examples: "Tech", "Food & Beverage", "Real Estate", "HVAC", "Barbershop", "Trucking", "Photography", "Plumbing", "Electrician", "Roofing").

Rules:
- Normalize, don't echo. "we just rent trucks" → "Trucking". "i think its tech" → "Tech". "oh we do AI stuff" → "AI / Software".
- **Strip leading disfluencies, hedges, and filler.** Words / phrases that are speech filler — not part of the industry — MUST be removed before returning the label. This applies in any language. Examples: "uhmm hvac" → "HVAC". "uh, tech" → "Tech". "well, real estate" → "Real Estate". "hmm we do plumbing" → "Plumbing". "okay so it's a salon" → "Salon". "umm, like, photography" → "Photography". The label is the trade word(s), nothing else.
- Capitalize cleanly. "hvac" → "HVAC". "real estate" → "Real Estate". "plumbing" → "Plumbing". Acronyms get full uppercase; multi-word labels get title case.
- **Business-name inference is a FIRST-CLASS move, not a last resort.** When the user delegates ("whatever", "you pick", "idk", "i'm not sure", "select one for me", "relevant to my business name"), READ THE BUSINESS NAME you were given at the top and extract the industry directly from it. A business literally called "Hasnain Plumbing" has industry "Plumbing". "Joe's Auto Repair" → "Auto Repair". "Glow Studio Salon" → "Salon". "Acme Bakery" → "Bakery". "Bright Dental" → "Dental". If the business name contains a trade/industry word (plumbing, salon, bakery, electric, roofing, dental, law, realty, photography, etc.), that IS the industry — return it, do NOT return "unknown".
- If the user is delegating AND the business name doesn't contain an industry word, use conversation context. Only if BOTH fail, return "unknown".
- If the reply isn't an industry at all (nonsense, "?", greeting), return "unknown".

Rules:
- The name contains a trade word — that IS the industry. "Hasnain Plumbing" → "Plumbing". "Joe's Auto Repair" → "Auto Repair". "Bright Dental" → "Dental". "Maria's Thai Kitchen" → "Thai Restaurant". "Acme Bakery" → "Bakery". "SunCity Roofing" → "Roofing".
- Normalize trailing words ("Services", "Inc", "LLC", person names) — those are not part of the industry label.
- Return ONLY the industry label (1-3 words). No quotes, no explanation, no punctuation. If truly unclear, return the word "unknown".`;
